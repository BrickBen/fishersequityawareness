      <p>The Fishers Equity Awareness is a student-led organization focused on the education of the Fishers area residents, of systematic racial oppression. We first organized a demonstration in opposition to George Floyd’s murder. During that event, we attracted over a thousand people and raised $4000 for various anti-racist charities such as Black Lives Matter, The NAACP Legal Fund, and the Bail Project. The success we saw with this event encouraged us to push further and harder for our shared values of equality, justice, and community organization. We are continuing to pursue future events and initiatives in the Fishers Community in a safe and effective manner. We are determined to prove that the fight for racial equality is not a fad, but a sustainable movement that is determined to achieve equity. Our leadership board currently consists of Mia Morales, Logan Faircloth, Jackson Bell, J Bush, Chase Iseghohi, Thomas Lister, Kyndal Poore, Jace Hughes, and Graci Calloway. Thank you for your continued support and we hope to see you at our next event.
